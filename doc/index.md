### [Database Migration](/doc/updates/db_migration.md)

The "Database Migration", "DB Migration", or "SQLite Migration" is an upcoming update to TagStudio which will replace the current JSON [library](/doc/library/library.md) with a SQL-based one, and will additionally include some fundamental changes to how some features such as [tags](/doc/library/tag.md) will work.
