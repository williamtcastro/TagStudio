# Library

The library is how TagStudio represents your chosen directory, with every file inside of it being displayed as an [entry](/doc/library/entry.md). You can have as many or few libraries as you wish, since each libraries' data is stored within a "`.TagStudio`" folder at its root.
Note that this means [tags](/doc/library/tag.md) you create only exist _per-library_.

### Library Contents

- [Entries](/doc/library/entry.md)
- [Fields](/doc/library/field.md)
- [Tags](/doc/library/tag.md)
- [Macros](/doc/utilities/macro.md)
